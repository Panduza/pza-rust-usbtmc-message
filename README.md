# Panduza Rust USBtmc Message

Helper to create and parse USBMC messages

This crate provides only the way to compose and decode USBtmc messages.
You need a USB lib to communicate with your device.
This crate is for developpers who want to create their own USBtmc crate with their own USB lib (like us in Panduza).
